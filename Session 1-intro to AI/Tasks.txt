#Task 2
"In the Advanced Vacuum Agent code, add the function ModelThinking_Movement() to check the cells Up, Down, Right, and Left. If a cell is dirty, move to that cell and clean it, then repeat the process.
Use logs to avoid repeating actions.
If all adjacent cells are clean, choose a random position.
Stop when the environment is completely clean or after reaching a maximum number of moves (10 by default, or as specified by the user in the Run method)."
